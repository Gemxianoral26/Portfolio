# Portfolio
Portfolio for my coding projects or games.

This isn't a professional repository, it's just something I want to have some fun with, so if you're a random person reading this, you can just leave.
I'm still learning how to program, but these are projects I'm proud of and want feedback on, so if you want to do that, please feel free to.
